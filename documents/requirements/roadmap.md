# DocsShelf Mobile App Development Roadmap and Next Steps

**Last Updated:** December 6, 2025  
**Current Status:** Phase 3 Complete - Production Readiness & Native Build Transition ✅  
**Next Steps:** Physical device testing, App Store submission preparation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the phased roadmap for developing the DocsShelf mobile app, a **native Android build** (with iOS support) document management solution focused on strict local storage, end-to-end encryption, and offline functionality. The roadmap is based on the comprehensive technical requirements document (`technical_requirements.md`) and follows industry best practices for React Native development.

**IMPORTANT CHANGE (Dec 6, 2025):** Development has transitioned to **native Android builds only**, removing `expo-dev-client` for better stability and production readiness.

The app aims to provide secure, efficient document handling with features like OCR, categorization, search, and local sharing. Development will prioritize security, performance, compliance, and user experience.

**Key Objectives**:

- Deliver a production-ready app within 6-9 months.
- Ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA, WCAG 2.1, and app store policies.
- Achieve <2s load times, <80MB RAM usage, and zero-knowledge encryption.
- Support 10,000+ documents with sub-500ms search.

**Assumptions**:

- Team: 1-2 developers (full-stack mobile), 1 QA, 1 designer.
- Tools: React Native CLI, Expo for prototyping, GitHub for version control.
- Budget: Covers development, testing, and basic deployment.

## 2. MVP Features

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on core functionalities that deliver value to users while validating the app's concept.
