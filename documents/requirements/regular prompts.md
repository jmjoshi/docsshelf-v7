## 📝 Note

**Important:** Session logs have been moved to dedicated files:
- **DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md** - Complete development context and session history
- **COMMAND_REFERENCE.md** - All commands, git operations, and development procedures

**This file (`regular prompts.md`) now contains ONLY the manual development guidelines and standard prompts that should be referenced during each development session.**

For session history and implementation details, please refer to the files above.
