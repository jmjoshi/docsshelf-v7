In the register account form something is changes I donot see the background text like first or last or email when entering info in a form.

Also can we make the application more appealing esthetically and also create logo or mascot for the application. Make it look professional and appealing. Also before that make sure we check in existing version with summary and updated and added components list with a tag MVP completed
