The development of features should be based on the these guidelines going forward, do I have to remind that every interaction or session?
------------------
Add packages only what is required for the feature development and keep track of changes all the time so that we can roll back changes to previous working version
------------------
create a plan document and save it under developments plans folder
------------------
Make sure it is compatible with all the existing packages and react native version
------------------
Always make sure going forward that the new packages are compatible with existing in package.json and should not impact adversely. Take the precausion always going forward to save time in debugging, fixing or roll backing the changes
------------------
create all unit and integration test cases for the developed feature, also do this every time new feature is developed. It should be executable.
